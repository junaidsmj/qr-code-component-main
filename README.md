## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties-

### What I learned

I learned that border-radius takes effect on the padding too. I added padding-bottom on the img therefore border-radius wasn't effecting the image from the bottom.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
img {
  width: 286px;
  height: auto;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me understand padding, root variables and border-radius.
